Project Title: Real-Time Weather App
Tools Used: Python and Streamlit
Prepared By: Abdul Razak

Introduction:
The main goal of this project is to make a simple web app that shows current weather and 5-day forecast for any city.
It helps users to know the temperature, humidity, sunrise, sunset, and weather condition in real-time.

Tools and Technologies Used:
o	Python – main programming language
o	Streamlit – to build the web app interface
o	Pandas – to manage and display forecast data
o	Requests – to connect to the weather API
o	OpenWeatherMap API – provides live weather data
o	HTML, CSS, JavaScript – for adding background animation

How the Project Works:
1.The user enters a city name.
2.The app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data.
3.The data includes temperature, humidity, sunrise/sunset, and forecast.
4.Using Pandas, the data is displayed neatly and a chart is shown for the 5-day forecast.
5.The background of the app changes (animated) based on the weather type (rainy, cloudy, sunny).

Features
o	Shows current weather details (temperature, humidity, sunrise, sunset)
o	Displays 5-day forecast using a line chart
o	Background animation changes with weather condition
o	User can choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit
o	Simple and interactive interface

Modules in the Project:
o	Input - User enters city name and temperature unit
o	API - Fetches live data from OpenWeatherMap
o	Processing - Organizes data using Pandas
o	Visualization - Displays data and charts in Streamlit
o	Animation - Adds weather-based background animation

Sample Output:
If user enters: London
Output:
o	Temperature: 15°C
o	Humidity: 82%
o	Sunrise: 06:45 AM
o	Sunset: 05:30 PM
o	Weather: Cloudy
o	Background: Cloud animation
o	5-day forecast chart shown below the details

Advantages:
o	Easy to use and understand
o	Gives real-time weather updates
o	Interactive and colorful display
o	Lightweight and runs in any browser

Limitations:
o	Needs internet connection
o	API key required from OpenWeatherMap
o	May not work if API request limit is reached

Future Improvements:
o	Detect location automatically
o	Add air quality information
o	Show weather alerts or warnings
o	Improve design with more effects

Conclusion:
This project helped me understand how to use APIs, Pandas, and Streamlit together.
It is a simple and practical project that shows how data from the internet can be used in real-time to make useful applications.
